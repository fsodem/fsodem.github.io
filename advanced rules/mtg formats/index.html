      In Magic: the Gathering, there are different ways to play. While they all use the same rules, there are certain additional rules that take effect. On this page, there are going to be profiles for different formats, along with some explanations. Here is a sample profile, with explanations of what certain terms mean.</p>
      <br/>
      <p class="standardText">
      <b><i>Sample</i></b>:
      <br/>
      Deck size: This is a rule dictating how many cards you should have in your deck.
      <br/>
      Sideboard: Rounds in a MTG tournament are ususally best out of three. During rounds, you can exchange cards from your sideboard with cards from your main deck.
      <br/>
      Copies of each card: This is a characteristic that decides how many copies of any given card you can have in your deck.
      <br/>
      Sets available: MTG cards are released in sets, groups of 200 cards, give or take a few, that go together. The sets are grouped into blocks, which is a group of sets that go together. Some formats only allow certain sets, meaning you can only play with the cards in those sets, and no others.
      <br/>
      Players: some formats are best played with different amounts of players.
      <br/>
      Special rules: Anything else that might matter.
    </p>

    <p class="section_header">Standard</p>
    <p class="standardText">
      Standard is probably the most commonly played format in MTG, but it has some limitations. Standard only allows more recent sets, so when sets go out of standard, cards leave standard too, and you end up having to rebuild your deck. While this prevents any one strategy from taking over the game it still can be frustrating for a casual player.
    </p>
    <p class="standardText">
      <strong><ins>Standard</ins></strong>
      <br/>
      Deck size: A standard deck can have at minimum 60 cards, and the maximum is that you need to be able to shuffle it yourself in a reasonable amount of time.
      <br/>
      Sideboard: Your sideboard can be up to fifteen cards.
      <br/>
      Copies of each card: You can only have up to four copies of any given card in your deck, excluding basic lands.
      <br/>
      Sets available. Four new magic sets are released every year. When the fall set is released, the four oldes sets stop being available in Standard.
      <br/>
      Players: Standard is best and usually played with two players.
      <br/>
      Special rules: None
