<h1>Welcome to MTG123!</h1>
<div id="bigDiv">
<h2>Learning MTG: Introduction</h2>
<div class="standardText"> <p> MTG stands for Magic: The Gathering. It is a trading card game, where each player brings a deck to the table and plays against an opponent.
It can be very complicated to learn, but a very rewarding and strategic experience if you do learn to play.</p></div>
    <h2>The goal of the game:</h2>
      <div class="standardText">
        <p>Each player starts with 20 health. If your opponent's heath goes to 0, they lose.
        If all your opponent(s) lose the game, you win
        If a card would allow you to win by some other means, you win.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Mana</h2>
      <div class="standardText"> <p>Mana is a resource you use to play cards. There are five different types.</p>
      <image class ="demoImage" src="media/magic related photos/all mana symbols.png" alt text="The mana symbols" width="20%" height="50%"></image>
      <p>In order, clockwise: White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green.</br>
      These colors are associated with, respectectively, the lands Plains, Islands, Swamps, Mountains, and Forests.
      Mana is produced by its respective land.</p></li></div>
    <h2>Playing Cards:</h2>
      <div class="standardText">
      <ul>
        <li> <p>Playing lands. Playing lands is simple. You can play one land per turn, no more. If you don't have any lands to play, too bad. You don't get a land.</li></p>
        <li><p>Playing spells. Anything that isn't a land is a spell. To play spells, you need to use <ins><strong>mana</strong></ins>.</p>
            <p>The amount of mana needed to play a spell is included in the upper right-hand corner. It is called the mana cost. It is made up of little symbols in circles. Either they looks like the mana symbols on lands, or they looks like a number in a grey circle. This is called generic mana.</p></li>
            <image class="demoImage" src="media/magic related photos/1 colorless mana.svg" alt text="1 generic mana" width="100" height="100"></image>
            <p>Lands only produce mana of a color. However, most cards have generic mana in their cost too. For example, look at khenra charioteer:</p>
            <image class="demoCard" src="media/magic card photos/khenra charioteer.png" alt text="khenra charioteer"></image>
            <p>There are three symbols in the top. One is red mana, one is green mana, and one is a sngle generic mana. Green mana means you need one green mana to play it. Red mana means you need one red mana to play it. Generic mana means you need one mana of <i>any</i> color to play it. So, to play khenra charioteer you would need one red mana, one green mana, and one mana of <i>any</i> color.
            To get mana, it's easy. You tap a land, and that land produces a mana of its color. Tapping a card means turning it sideways. This usually symbolizes it being used up for the turn. You can only tap things once per turn - if something's tapped, you can't tap it again.
            So, in conclusion, to play khenra charioteer, you would have to tap one mountain, one forest, and one land of any color. This is the same for every spell(aka every card that is not a land.) - the generic mana needs to be paired up with the colored mana to cast the spell. In this example. we used a creature, although the card types vary. Mana costs are different from card to card, which influences how you play any given card.</p>
            <p>Important note: In our examples, the generic mana is represented by a 1 in a circle. However, this is often not the case. Any number can be in that gray circle; more gray circles are not required. However, several <i>colored</i> mana symbols each require their own symbol. In the example of Ancient Silverback (shown below), he requires four generic mana, or mana of any color, and two green mana. Notice how the four is in a single grey circle, but both green mana are in separate circles.</p>

          </div>

        <h2>Creatures</h2>
          <div class="standardText"><p>
            Creatures are one of the most important card types in magic, and also one of the more complicated, because they have to engage in combat.
            Take a look at a creature. We already saw this one - ancient silverback.</p>
            <image class="demoCard" src="media/magic card photos/ancient silverback.png" alt text="ancient silverback"></image>
            <p>In the top left-hand corner of a creature, you have its name, and in the top right, its mana cost. These will be present regardless of whether or not this is a creature; they're in every card.
              Under that, a card's art, and below that, its type. In this case, since the silverback is a creature, it says "creature", and then specifies ape. Most card types do not contain this specification, but creatures do. There could be several things, like "goblin shaman" or "human warrior". In this case, however, it just says "ape".



    <h2>The turn:</h2>
      A turn in MTG has many phases. Here they are, in order.
      <ul>
        <li>The untap step. When you use cards, they becomed tapped, which means they are turned sideways, to represent that they have been used for the turn.
          During this step, you turn all your cards forward again, to show that they are ready to use again.</li>
        <li>The Upkeep. Normally, nothing happens during this step. However, it's used to mark the start of a turn. For example, it a card wants something to happen at the start of your turn. it'll say "at the beginning of your upkeep", which means during this phase.</li>
        <li>The Draw Phase. At the start of this phase, you draw a card from your <ins>library</ins>, and you put it in your hand. Library is MTG speak for deck.</li>
        <li>First Main Phase. During this turn, you play cards from your hand. </li>
