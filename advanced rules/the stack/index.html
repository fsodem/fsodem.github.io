  <p class="title">The Stack</p>

  <div class="big_div_advanced_pages">
    <p class="standardText">
      The stack is probably one of the most fundamental concepts in Magic: the Gathering. That's unfortunate, because it's also one of the most complicated.
      <br/>
      The stack is the place where things go, cards or abilities, between when you play them and when they take effect.
      <br/>
       Let's say I have a creature in my hand. When I tap the mana to play it, it doens't go directly to the battlefield. First, it goes to stack. You can view the stack as a sort of pending area for cards that have been played but haven't taken effect yet. When something goes on the stack, and then every player says they won't interfere with it, it can resolve. This means it leaves the stack and does its effect. For instants and sorceries, they do an effect and go to the graveyard. For abilities, their effect happens. For permanents, they go to the battlefield.
       <br/>
       This is great and all, you might say, but what's the point? The point, dear friend, is technicalities.
     </p>

     <p class="section_header">In response</p>

     <p class="standardText">
       In response is a very technical concept in MTG. It basically means that your opponent put something on the stack, and then you said "Wait! That can't resolve yet!", and then you play something of your own. Because here's a fundamental concept in MTG: the stack resolves in the opposite order than things were played on it. That's where the name comes from.
       <br/>
       Let's say I play a lightning bolt, in an attempt to kill your 2/2 creature.
     </p>

     <img class="demoCard" src="/media/magic card photos/lightning bolt.jpg">

     <p class="standardText">
       My lightning bolt goes on the stack. Let's imagine I place it on the table. But you say: "Not so fast!" <strong>In response</strong> to my lightning bolt, you play unsummon to save your creature.
     </p>

     <img class="demoCard" src="/media/magic card photos/unsummon.jpg">

     <p class="standardText">
       Unsummon goes on the stack, and because you played it after lightning bolt, but before lightning bolt resolved, it goes on the stack after it but will resolve first. Let's imagine you placed your unsummon on top of my lightning bolt on the table, thus forming a <strong>stack</strong> of cards. Clever, Eh? If, at that point, we both do not want to play anything else, the stack resolves. Let's go back to our metaphor of a stack of cards on the table for a second. It resolves from the top down, which means it must start with the last card played and end with the first card played, going down through the stack. So, back to our example.
       <br/>
       The unsummon takes effect first, since it was higher up on the stack, and your creature goes back into your hand. Then, the lightning bolt takes effect. Since its would be target is no longer in the battlefield, it has no effect.
     </p>

    <p class="section_header">What goes on the stack, and what doesn't</p>

    <p class="standardText">
      There are some things that go on the stack, and some that don't. First, a list of things that <b>do</b> go on the stack.
      <br/>
      <strong><ins>Phases</ins></strong> All phases of a turn go on the stack, and you can cast things in response to them.
      <br/>
      <strong><ins>Spells</ins></strong> Everything that you cast, be it instant, sorcery, creature, enchantment, artifact, all go on the stack before taking effect.
      <br/>
      <strong><ins>Abilities</ins></strong> Triggered and Activated abilitis go on the stack before they take effect.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      There is a somewhat longer list of things, a little more specific, that don't use the stack. Instead, they happen immediately. This means that once they start happening, they finish before anything else can happen.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong><ins>Lands</ins></strong> Lands are not spells and as such do not go on the stack.
      <br/>
      <strong><ins>Mana abilities</ins></strong> Any ability that produces mana does not use the stack, including a land tapping.
      <br/>
      <strong><ins>Damage</ins></strong> Damage happens immediately and doesn't use the stack.
      <br/>
      <strong><ins>Drawing cards</ins></strong> Drawing cards in itself does not go on the stack, but if a spell or ability has for effect drawing cards, that spell or ability still has to goon the stack, then resolve and you immediately draw a card.
      <br/>
      <strong><ins>Passive abilities</ins></strong> don't go on the stack. Their effect is continuous.
      <br/>
      So that's it for the stack. It is very confusing, but getting someone else to explain it to you or rereading this section could help. Good luck!
