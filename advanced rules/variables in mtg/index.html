  <p class="title"> Variables in MTG</p>
  <div class="big_div_advanced_pages" >

    <p class="standardText">
      In Magic: the Gathering, things are not always hard set. Some cards have variables, that affect the way their abilities function. The first of these is the X.
    </p>

    <p class="section_header">The X</p>
    <img class="demoImage" src="/media/magic related photos/x symbol.png">

    <p class="standardText">
      The X is a variable that represents a mana cost. This means that the cost of a card or ability can vary, depending on how much mana you decide to pay for the X. Usually, this affects the power of the ability or card as well. Here is an example of X where it is most often found, in the mana cost of cards.
    </p>

    <img class="demoCard" src="/media/magic card photos/mind spring.jpg">

    <p class="standardText">
      Here, we see the X in the mana cost. It is alongside two blue mana. This means that to pay, you already have to pay two blue mana. Then, you can dedicate everything else to the X. It can be any number, including 0 (althoug casting it for 0 would be pointless). In the effect of the card, we see that you draw X cards. This simply means that however much mana I paid for the X, I draw that many cards. So, if I cast it for two blue, and then four mana in the X, for a total cost of six mana, I would draw 4 cards. X can be used the same way with the same effect in abilities. But X is not always a mana cost.
    </p>

    <p class="standardText">
      In this example, the X is a little bit harder to spot. In the first ability, we can see one of the costs is "Sacrifice X other creatures". This means that you sacrifice any number of creatures, including 0, and then do the ability's effect with the value X being the number of sacrificed creatures. Here we see X as it is sometimes used: as a variable assigned to something other than mana.
      <br/>
      Note: the multi-X.
    </p>

    <img class="demoCard" src="/media/magic card photos/astral cornucopia.jpg">

    <p class="standardText">
      In this example, we see the X three times in the mana cost of the card. This means something special. It is not all that common, although not very rare. The number of Xs can be 1, 2, 3, or more (although it is rarer). What this means is that to have something be X, you have to pay (in this case) three times the mana to get the value of X to be one. So, if you pay 6 mana the X would be 2. You must use a number divisible by three if there are three Xs. So, you can pay 3, 6, 9, etc. mana.
      <br/>
      Note: X can always be paid with any kind of mana, like generic mana.
      <br/>
      Note: the Y. The Y as a variable is infintely less common than the X, and is only used in a situation where two variables would be needed, both of them having the characteristics of the X. In that case, one of them becomes Y.
      <br/>
      The X is not, however, the only variabe in MTG
    </p>

    <p class="section_header">The star</p>

    <p class="standardText">
      The star is another variable in MTG and while it less common than the X, it is not extremely rare. The star often takes the place value of a creature's power or toughness. In the example below, nightmare, the creature has stars instead of power and tougness.
    </p>

    <img class="demoCard" src="/media/magic card photos/nightmare.jpg" alt text="Nightmare">

    <p class="standardText">
      The stars always represent identical values, and that value is specified in the text box and often changes over time. For example, in Nightmare's text box we can see that he gets stronger the more swamps you play, as his power and toughness is equal to that number, but then also weaker if swamps are removed.
      <br/>
      While stars are most often seen as both power and toughness, this is sometimes not the case. In the esample below, the creature has a set 3 toughness that doesn't change and a power, represented by a star, that does.
    </p>

    <img class="demoCard" src="/media/magic card photos/spellheart chimera.jpg" alt text="spelltide Chimera">

    <p class="standardText">
      In this example, we see a good example of the single star: the power changes over time and the toughness does not. This is how almost all single star cards are organized.
