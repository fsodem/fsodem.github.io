<h2>Learning MTG:</h2>
MTG stands for Magic: The Gathering. It is a trading card game, where each player brings a deck to the table and plays against an opponent.
It can be very complicated to learn, but a very rewarding and strategic experience if you do learn to play.
  <ol>
    <li><h2>The goal of the game:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player starts with 20 health. If your opponent's heath goes to 0, they lose.</li>
        <li>If all your opponent(s) lose the game, you win</li>
        <li> If a card would allow you to win by some other means, you win.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

      A turn in MTG has many phases. Here they are, in order.
      <ul>
        <li>The untap step. When you use cards, they becomed tapped, which means they are turned sideways, to represent that they have been used for the turn.
          During this step, you turn all your cards forward again, to show that they are ready to use again.</li>
        <li>The Upkeep. Normally, nothing happens during this step. However, it's used to mark the start of a turn. For example, it a card wants something to happen at the start of your turn. it'll say "at the beginning of your upkeep", which means during this phase.</li>
        <li>The Draw Phase. At the start of this phase, you draw a card from your <ins>library</ins>, and you put it in your hand. Library is MTG speak for deck.</li>
